# RaptorChain
A chain for RPTR (Raptor Token), but still under development !!!



## State of development
### What works ?
- Transfers (raptorchain address to another raptorchain address)
- Using BEP20 tokens on RPTR testnet
- Multi-asset bridge (transfer any BEP20 between raptorchain and bsc)
- EVM

### What's under development ?
- Reducing fee on withdrawal
	Basically, raptorchain-to-bsc communications works by operating an instance of raptorchain's beacon chain (which contains cross-chain data and is getting used as time anchor).
	Thus, broadcasting one block per 10 minutes is very expensive !

## Wanna try it ?
### Testnet/devnet address
Node ip : `https://rpc-testnet.raptorchain.io/web3`

chainID : `0x7452505452`

chainID (in decimal format) : `499597202514`

ticker : `tRPTR`


But if you wanna try network right now, feel free to ask for some test tokens (it isn't real RPTR) at [@ygboucherk on telegram](https://t.me/ygboucherk) or `yanis#3059` on discord
