# RaptorChain
A chain for RPTR (Raptor Token), but still under development !!!

## What works ?
- Transfers (raptorchain address to another raptorchain address)
- Deposits (bsc to raptorchain)


## What's needed (mandatory before mainnet release) ?
- Withdrawals (raptorchain to bsc) : that's what I'm working on with https://github.com/raptor-finance/raptorchain/tree/back-and-forth-transfers


## What's not mandtory but would be very useful ?
- EVM implementation (allows to run smart contracts same way as bsc or ethereum)
