# RaptorChain
A chain for RPTR (Raptor Token), but still under development !!!



## State of development
### What works ?
- Transfers (raptorchain address to another raptorchain address)
- Deposits (bsc to raptorchain)


### What's needed (mandatory before mainnet release) ?
- Withdrawals (raptorchain to bsc) : that's what I'm working on with [back-and-forth-transfers branch](https://github.com/raptor-finance/raptorchain/tree/back-and-forth-transfers)


### What's not mandatory but would be very useful ?
- EVM implementation (allows to run smart contracts same way as bsc or ethereum)



## Wanna try it ?
### Testnet/devnet address
Node ip : `http://136.244.119.124:2022/web3` (note it's http and not https, else it won't work)

chainID : `69420`

ticker : `tRPTR`


### Getting some test tokens
Will add a testnet faucet soon.

But if you wanna try network right now, feel free to ask for some test tokens (it isn't real RPTR) at [@ygboucherk on telegram](https://t.me/ygboucherk) or `yanis#3059` on discord
